2.2  Topology description of the simulation domain

Ok, so what are all these “objects” for? The first line of
the simulation file defines a graph representing the
general layout of the simulation domain and follows this
syntax:

1st field
    number of nodes in the graph (1)
2nd field
    number of edges connecting the nodes (2)
3rd field
    object type for the graph (GfsSimulation)
4th field
    default object type for the nodes (GfsBox)
5th field
    object type for the edges (GfsGEdge)
6th field
    1st optional parameters (braced block)
7th field
    2nd optional parameters (braced block)
